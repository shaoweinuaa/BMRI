"BMRI" is a package written in Matlab and the name stands for "Batch mode active learning method by quering the most representative and informative samples". 

myTest.m is the main function that compares the proposed BMRI and RANDOM query methods. 

simulation.mat is the simulation datset, which contains 200 dimensional samples that are drawn from each of the two uniform distributed classes, the positive class has the mean(1,1), variance(1,1), and the negative class has the mean(-1,-1),variance(1,1).
